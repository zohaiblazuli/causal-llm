## Risk Assessment

### Overall Risk: LOW

**Critical Risks**: None identified
**Important Risks**: None identified
**Minor Risks**: Manageable with standard practices

### Potential Training Considerations

1. **Category-Specific Overfitting**
   - Risk: Email category has 35% of data
   - Mitigation: Dropout (0.1-0.2), early stopping, stratified evaluation

2. **Difficulty Imbalance**
   - Risk: Medium examples dominate (47%)
   - Mitigation: Difficulty-stratified metrics, weighted loss if needed

3. **Length Correlation**
   - Risk: Longer examples correlate with difficulty
   - Mitigation: Expected behavior, monitor attention patterns

**None of these are blockers** - standard ML training practices apply.
