## Notes & Context

### Project Philosophy
This project aims to bridge the gap between empirical LLM safety approaches and formal verification. The key insight is using causal intervention to create learnable safety invariants that can be formally proven, rather than relying solely on empirical testing.

### Success Criteria
- Formal proof of safety guarantees under specified attack models
- Demonstrable robustness improvement over baseline approaches
- Minimal performance degradation on legitimate tasks
- Novel contribution to LLM safety literature
- Compelling ISEF presentation and demo

### Coordination Notes
- Update this file after completing each milestone
- Review weekly to identify blockers and risks
- Use daily logs for detailed progress tracking
- Escalate timeline concerns immediately
