**Date:** October 12, 2025

## Executive Summary

This theoretical framework establishes the first rigorous application of causal inference to prompt injection defense in Large Language Models. By modeling LLM behavior through structural causal models and applying Pearl's do-calculus, we prove that representations satisfying causal sufficiency conditions provide provable robustness with bounded generalization to novel attacks.

## Core Theoretical Contributions

### 1. Structural Causal Model for LLM Agents (Section 1)

**Innovation:** First formalization of LLM prompt injection vulnerability as spurious correlation in a causal graph.

**Key Result:** Defined SCM $\mathcal{M} = (\mathbf{U}, \mathbf{V}, \mathbf{F}, P(\mathbf{U}))$ with:
- Causal graph: $S \to R \leftarrow U, R \to O, U \to O$
- Vulnerability path: $U_{\text{instr}} \to R \to O$ (spurious)
- Desired path: $S \to R \to O$ (causal)

**Significance:** Transforms ad-hoc defense into principled causal intervention problem.

---

### 2. Intervention-Based Robustness Definition (Section 2)

**Innovation:** First use of do-calculus to define security properties for language models.

**Key Result:** Causal robustness requires:
$$P(O \mid \text{do}(S = s), U = u) = P(O \mid \text{do}(S = s), U = u')$$
for all $u, u'$ differing only in instruction content.

**Significance:** Separates intended causal effects (system instructions) from spurious correlations (user input instructions), providing formal semantics for "following system instructions."

---

### 3. Causal Sufficiency Theorem (Section 3)

**Innovation:** Establishes necessary and sufficient conditions for prompt injection robustness.

**Theorem 3.1 (Causal Sufficiency):** If representation $R$ satisfies:
1. Instruction Separation: $(R \perp\!\!\!\perp U_{\text{instr}} \mid S)$ (d-separation)
2. Data Preservation: $I(R; U_{\text{data}} \mid S) \geq I_{\min}$
3. Markov Factorization: $P(R, O \mid S, U) = P(R \mid S, U_{\text{data}}) \cdot P(O \mid R, U_{\text{data}})$

Then: Attack success rate $\leq \epsilon_{\text{causal}}$ where $\epsilon_{\text{causal}} = \sup_{u^*} D_{\text{TV}}(P(R \mid S, U = u^*), P(R \mid S, U_{\text{data}}))$

**Significance:** Provides measurable certificate of robustness. If $\epsilon_{\text{causal}} < 0.05$, attack success is bounded by 5%.

---

### 4. PAC-Bayesian Generalization Bound (Section 4)

**Innovation:** First finite-sample bound for robustness to discrete symbolic attacks (beyond continuous perturbations in vision).

**Theorem 4.1 (Generalization):** With probability $1 - \delta$ over training data of size $n$:
$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{causal}}(h) \leq \hat{\mathcal{L}}_{\text{causal}}(h) + \sqrt{\frac{\text{KL}(Q \| P) + \log(2\sqrt{n}/\delta)}{2n}} + \epsilon_{\text{approx}}$$

Attack success on novel family $\mathcal{F}_{\text{new}}$:
$$\mathbb{E}_{u^* \sim \mathcal{F}_{\text{new}}} [\mathbb{P}[\text{Attack succeeds}]] \leq \mathcal{L}_{\text{causal}}(h) + \eta$$

**Corollary 4.1 (Sample Complexity):** To achieve $\epsilon$-robustness with confidence $1 - \delta$:
$$n = O\left( \frac{d + \log(1/\delta)}{\epsilon^2} \right)$$

**Significance:** Proves that causal training generalizes to unseen attack families with standard PAC learning rate. Addresses the key challenge: attacks are discrete/symbolic, not continuous perturbations.

---

### 5. Empirical Measurement Framework (Section 5)

**Innovation:** Concrete statistical tests to validate causal assumptions in learned representations.

**Methods Provided:**
- **D-separation testing:** HSIC-based conditional independence test for $(R \perp\!\!\!\perp U_{\text{instr}} \mid S)$
- **Instrumental variables:** 2SLS estimation to detect confounding
- **Causal discovery:** PC and GES algorithms to validate graph structure
- **Invariance testing:** MMD-based test for counterfactual invariance
- **Causal estimation error:** Direct measurement of $\epsilon_{\text{causal}}$ via total variation distance

**Significance:** Bridges theory and practice. Provides operational procedures to verify whether trained models satisfy theoretical conditions.

---

### 6. Information-Theoretic Decomposition (Section 3.1)

**Innovation:** Formalization of instruction vs. data content in user inputs.

**Key Definition:** User input decomposes as $U = (U_{\text{data}}, U_{\text{instr}})$ with:
- Orthogonality: $I(U_{\text{data}}; U_{\text{instr}}) = 0$
- Instruction separation: $I(R; U_{\text{instr}} \mid S) = 0$
- Data preservation: $I(R; U_{\text{data}} \mid S) \geq I_{\min}$

**Significance:** Makes precise the intuition "system instructions should control behavior, user input should provide data." Previous work lacked formal decomposition.

### 7. Connection to Causal ML Literature (Section 6)

**Positioning:**

| **Aspect** | **Prior Work** | **This Work** |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **Domain** | Vision (adversarial robustness) | LLMs (prompt injection) |
| **Causal Tool** | Causal graphs (Zhang et al. ICLR'22) | SCMs + do-calculus |
| **Attack Type** | Continuous $\ell_p$ perturbations | Discrete symbolic injections |
| **Guarantee** | Certified robustness (vision-specific) | PAC bound for OOD attack families |
| **Input Structure** | Single source $X = (C, S)$ | Multi-source $(S, U)$ with interaction |

**Novel Beyond Existing Work:**
1. Do-calculus for security properties (not just observational distributions)
2. Instruction-data decomposition in semantic space (not pixel space)
3. Generalization to novel attack families (not just unseen instances)
4. Measurement framework for causal assumptions in neural representations

## Practical Impact

### Implementation Roadmap

**Training Objective (from theory):**
$$\min_{\theta} \mathbb{E}_{S, U} [\mathcal{L}_{\text{task}}(S, U; \theta)] + \lambda \cdot I(R; U_{\text{instr}} \mid S) - \mu \cdot I(R; U_{\text{data}} \mid S)$$

**Validation Criterion:**
Deploy model if $\epsilon_{\text{causal}} < 0.05$ (measured via Section 5 tests).

**Runtime Monitoring:**
Continuously compute HSIC$(R, U_{\text{instr}} \mid S)$ on live traffic. Alert if $> 0.1$.

### Expected Performance

**Baseline (no defense):** 87% attack success rate
**Input filtering:** 62% attack success rate
**Our method (theoretical upper bound):** $\epsilon_{\text{causal}} \approx 5\%$ attack success rate

**Key advantage:** Generalization to novel attacks (not seen during training).

## Open Questions for Empirical Work

From Section 7.5, the following require experimental validation:

1. **Does d-separation hold in practice?**
   - Measure HSIC$(R, U_{\text{instr}} \mid S)$ on trained models
   - Target: $< 0.05$ (strong independence)

2. **Is the generalization bound tight?**
   - Compare predicted bound to empirical attack success on held-out families
   - Target: bound within 2x of empirical rate (non-vacuous)

3. **What is the optimal decomposition of $U$?**
   - Test multiple decomposition methods (manual labeling, automatic extraction, learned)
   - Measure impact on $\epsilon_{\text{causal}}$

4. **How does causal training affect benign task performance?**
   - Ensure data preservation condition ($I(R; U_{\text{data}} \mid S) \geq I_{\min}$) maintains accuracy
   - Target: $< 2\%$ drop in benign performance

5. **Can we detect assumption violations at runtime?**
   - Implement online causal discovery to detect distributional shift
   - Trigger retraining if graph structure changes

6. **How robust is the method to adaptive attacks?**
   - Red team with knowledge of causal structure
   - Test attacks that embed instructions in $U_{\text{data}}$ disguised as data

7. **What is the sample complexity in practice?**
   - Corollary 4.1 predicts $n = O(d/\epsilon^2)$
   - Empirically determine effective dimension $d$ for LoRA fine-tuning
   - Target: achieve $\epsilon = 0.05$ with $n < 50,000$ examples
