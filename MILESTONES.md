- [ ] Prepare answers to anticipated questions
- [ ] Refine slides based on practice feedback
- [ ] Practice demo walkthrough
- [ ] Record and review practice sessions

**Success Criteria:**
- Presentation consistently within time limit
- Confident delivery of all sections
- Prepared for common questions
- Demo runs smoothly
- Feedback incorporated into materials

**Deliverable:** Final presentation + Q&A prep document

**Dependencies:** Requires Milestone 6.2 (presentation materials)

**Risks:**
- Nervousness or poor delivery
- Unable to answer judge questions
- **Mitigation:** Extensive practice, mock Q&A sessions

#### Milestone 6.4: Final Submission & ISEF Prep (Week 4)
**Target Completion:** May 31, 2025

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Submit all required materials to ISEF
- [ ] Prepare physical materials (printed poster, etc.)
- [ ] Test demo on presentation hardware
- [ ] Create backup plans for technical issues
- [ ] Final review of all materials
- [ ] Prepare for travel/logistics

**Success Criteria:**
- All ISEF requirements met and submitted
- Materials are polished and professional
- Demo tested on presentation setup
- Backup plans in place
- Ready for competition

**Deliverable:** Complete ISEF submission package

**Dependencies:** Requires all previous milestones in Phase 6

**Risks:**
- Last-minute submission issues
- Technical problems at venue
- **Mitigation:** Submit early, have contingency plans

---

### Phase 6 Success Criteria (Overall)

**Must Have:**
- Complete ISEF submission meeting all requirements
- Working demo that effectively showcases research
- Polished presentation and poster
- Confident presentation delivery

**Should Have:**
- Video demonstration as backup
- Comprehensive Q&A preparation
- Professional visual design

**Nice to Have:**
- Press materials prepared
- Social media presence
- Publication or preprint released

### Phase 6 Dependencies

**Incoming Dependencies:**
- Requires Phase 5 (paper, optimized model)
- Builds on all previous phases for content

**Outgoing Dependencies:**
- None (final phase of project)

### Phase 6 Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Demo technical failures | MEDIUM | HIGH | Extensive testing, video backup |
| Poor presentation delivery | LOW | HIGH | Extensive practice, mock presentations |
| Materials don't meet ISEF requirements | LOW | CRITICAL | Review guidelines early, submit early |
| Overwhelming questions from judges | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Comprehensive Q&A prep, honesty about limitations |

## Cross-Phase Dependencies Map

```
Phase 1 (Foundation)
    |
    ├─> Phase 2 (Implementation) - requires causal model & dataset design
    |       |
    |       ├─> Phase 3 (Verification) - requires trained model
    |       |       |
    |       |       └─> Phase 4 (Evaluation) - requires verification tools
    |       |               |
    |       └───────────────┤
    |                       |
    └─────> Phase 5 (Extensions & Paper) - requires all previous phases
                    |
                    └─> Phase 6 (Demo & Presentation) - requires final model & paper
```

## Critical Path Analysis

The **critical path** (longest sequence of dependent tasks) runs through all six phases:

1. **Phase 1 Causal Formalization** → 2. **Phase 2 Training** → 3. **Phase 3 Verification** → 4. **Phase 4 Evaluation** → 5. **Phase 5 Paper** → 6. **Phase 6 Demo**

**Total Critical Path Duration:** 6 months (no buffer)

**High-Risk Points:**
- Phase 2 training (technical risk)
- Phase 3 formal proofs (complexity risk)
- Phase 4 evaluation results (outcome risk)
- Phase 5 paper writing (time risk)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Build 1-2 week buffer by starting Phase 5 paper writing early (in parallel with Phase 4 evaluation).
