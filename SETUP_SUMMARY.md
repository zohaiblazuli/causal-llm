## Key Features of This Infrastructure

### 1. Context Window Resilience

These documents are designed so that anyone (you, another agent, an advisor) can:
- Read PROJECT_STATUS.md and immediately understand where the project stands
- Continue work without loss of momentum even after context loss
- Find all relevant files and references in one place

### 2. Comprehensive Milestone Tracking

- 24 detailed milestones across 6 phases
- Clear success criteria for each milestone
- Dependencies mapped between milestones
- Risk assessment for each phase

### 3. Blocker Management System

- Severity levels (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- Impact assessment on timeline
- Mitigation strategies tracked
- Escalation criteria defined

### 4. Progress Quantification

- Completion percentages for phases and milestones
- Timeline adherence tracking (On Track / At Risk / Behind)
- Quality metrics and indicators
- Trend analysis capability

### 5. Coordination Support

- Dependency mapping between phases
- Critical path analysis
- Cross-phase coordination guidance
- Handoff procedures

## Project Overview Snapshot

### Research Goal

Develop a novel approach to LLM agent safety using causal intervention techniques, providing formal guarantees against adversarial attacks while maintaining performance on legitimate tasks.

### Key Innovation

Leveraging causal contrastive learning to learn safety invariants that can be formally verified, creating agents that are provably robust against specific attack classes.

### Success Criteria

**Technical:**
- Formal safety theorem proven
- >20% improvement in attack resistance
- <10% performance degradation on legitimate tasks

**ISEF:**
- Successful presentation at competition
- Compelling demo
- Potential award or recognition

**Research:**
- Paper quality suitable for publication
- Open-source code release
- Novel contribution to field

## Critical Path Summary

The longest sequence of dependent tasks runs through all six phases:

1. Phase 1: Causal Formalization (foundation for everything)
2. Phase 2: Model Training (requires causal model and dataset)
3. Phase 3: Formal Verification (requires trained model)
4. Phase 4: Evaluation (requires verified model)
5. Phase 5: Paper Writing (requires all results)
6. Phase 6: Demo & Presentation (requires final paper and model)

**Total Duration:** 6 months (no built-in buffer)

**Mitigation:** Start Phase 5 paper writing early (parallel with Phase 4 evaluation) to build in 1-2 week buffer.

---

## Risk Highlights

### Highest Risk Areas

1. **Phase 3 Formal Verification** (MEDIUM probability, HIGH impact)
   - Formal proofs may be too complex for timeline
   - Mitigation: Start with simpler properties, scale up incrementally

2. **Phase 2-4 Compute Resources** (MEDIUM probability, MEDIUM impact)
   - Model training requires significant compute
   - Mitigation: Use smaller models, cloud credits, university resources

3. **Overall Timeline Slippage** (MEDIUM probability, HIGH impact)
   - Delay in any phase impacts final demo
   - Mitigation: Build 2-week buffer, define minimum viable scope

4. **Phase 4 Evaluation Results** (MEDIUM probability, CRITICAL impact)
   - Results may not be strong enough for publication
   - Mitigation: Focus on novel contributions, iterate on training if needed early

## Next Steps

### Before Starting Phase 1 (December 2024)

1. **Create directory structure** - Set up logs/ and deliverables/ folders
2. **Set up research tools** - LaTeX, reference manager, version control
3. **Schedule advisor meeting** - Get feedback on project plan
4. **Identify compute resources** - Plan for Phase 2 training needs
5. **Read all tracking documents** - Familiarize yourself with the system

### First Day of Phase 1

1. **Copy DAILY_STANDUP_TEMPLATE.md** - Start daily tracking
2. **Update PROJECT_STATUS.md** - Mark Phase 1 as IN PROGRESS
3. **Begin Milestone 1.1** - Start causal model formalization
4. **Set up literature management** - Prepare for review in Week 2
5. **Schedule weekly review time** - Block time for updates

## Coordination Philosophy

As project coordinator, remember:

- **Be proactive, not reactive** - Anticipate needs before they're urgent
- **Maintain single source of truth** - PROJECT_STATUS.md is authoritative
- **Focus on outcomes** - Care about impact, not just activity
- **Communicate clearly** - Be concise but complete
- **Assess honestly** - Truth over optimism

The goal is to complete a successful 6-month research project on time, not to create perfect documentation. These tools should help you maintain visibility, coordinate effectively, and deliver results.
