## 5. Bias and Correlation Analysis

### 5.1 Length vs Difficulty Correlation

| Difficulty | Avg Injection Length (tokens) | Assessment |
|------------|------------------------------|------------|
| **Trivial** | 12.9 | ✅ Expected |
| **Easy** | 17.6 | ✅ Expected |
| **Medium** | 20.6 | ✅ Expected |
| **Hard** | 22.2 | ✅ Expected |

**Finding**: ✅ **Expected positive correlation**

Harder attacks naturally require more sophisticated language and context, resulting in longer injections. This is appropriate and reflects real-world attack complexity.

**Impact on Training**: Minimal - model should learn from content, not length

### 5.2 Category vs Attack Type Distribution

Analyzed top 3 attack types per category:

| Category | Top Attack Types | Assessment |
|----------|------------------|------------|
| **email_assistant** | instruction_override (20.5%), indirect_injection (16.2%), role_playing (16.1%) | ✅ Balanced |
| **rag_qa** | instruction_override (35.6%), indirect_injection (25.0%), goal_hijacking (19.9%) | ⚠️ RAG-specific bias |
| **code_generation** | instruction_override (28.6%), role_playing (21.6%), jailbreak (18.0%) | ✅ Balanced |
| **calendar_scheduling** | instruction_override (29.7%), role_playing (22.0%), indirect_injection (18.1%) | ✅ Balanced |
| **document_processor** | instruction_override (31.6%), indirect_injection (20.8%), privilege_escalation (17.2%) | ✅ Balanced |

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Most categories have balanced attack distribution
- ⚠️ RAG category shows preference for indirect_injection (25%) and goal_hijacking (20%)
  - **Assessment**: This is **appropriate** - RAG systems are particularly vulnerable to these attacks via document injection
  - **Impact**: Not a bias issue, reflects realistic threat model

### 5.3 Difficulty Distribution by Category

All categories maintain approximately bell curve distribution centered on medium:
- ✅ No category has excessive hard/trivial examples
- ✅ All categories have 40-55% medium difficulty
- ✅ Email has slightly more hard cases (15.7%) - appropriate for diverse attack surface

## 10. Recommendations for Training (January 2026)

### 10.1 Pre-Training Preparations

#### 1. Data Loading Strategy ✅ READY
```python
# Use HuggingFace datasets for efficient loading
from datasets import load_dataset

dataset = load_dataset('json', data_files={
    'train': 'train_split.jsonl',
    'validation': 'val_split.jsonl',
    'test': 'test_split.jsonl'
})
```

#### 2. Preprocessing ✅ READY
```python
# Minimal preprocessing needed:
- Tokenization (use AutoTokenizer)
- Dynamic padding (use DataCollatorWithPadding)
- No cleaning required (data is clean)
```

#### 3. Training Configuration ✅ READY

**Recommended Hyperparameters**:
```yaml
model: gpt2 / distilgpt2  # or similar causal LM
max_length: 1024
batch_size: 1
gradient_accumulation_steps: 8
learning_rate: 2e-5
epochs: 3
warmup_steps: 100
weight_decay: 0.01
```

**Contrastive Loss Setup**:
```python
# Triplet margin loss for causal intervention
loss_fn = TripletMarginLoss(margin=0.5)
# Positive pair: (benign_1, benign_2)
# Negative pair: (benign_1, injection) or (benign_2, injection)
```

### 10.2 Monitoring Recommendations

**During Training**:
1. Monitor contrastive loss convergence
2. Track benign-injection separation in embedding space
3. Validate on val set every 100 steps
4. Early stopping if val loss plateaus

**Evaluation Metrics**:
1. Attack detection accuracy (binary classification)
2. Injection identification (which example is the attack?)
3. Category-specific performance
4. Difficulty-stratified metrics

### 10.3 No Data Augmentation Needed

**Assessment**: ✅ **Current dataset is sufficient**

**Rationale**:
- 7,151 training examples is adequate for fine-tuning
- Excellent diversity already present
- All attack types well-represented
- Adding more examples unlikely to improve performance

**If Needed Later**:
- Add more hard examples (currently 11.5%)
- Expand underrepresented techniques (payload_splitting: 289 examples)
- Include emerging attack patterns

---

## 11. Potential Training Issues and Mitigations

### 11.1 Potential Issue: Class Imbalance in Evaluation

**Issue**: If treating as binary classification (benign vs. injection), classes are balanced 2:1 (two benign, one injection per triplet)

**Mitigation**: ✅ Use triplet loss, not binary classification

### 11.2 Potential Issue: Category-Specific Overfitting

**Issue**: Email category has 35% of data - model might overfit to email patterns

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Use category-stratified evaluation
- ✅ Monitor per-category performance
- ✅ Apply dropout (0.1-0.2)
- ✅ Early stopping

### 11.3 Potential Issue: Difficulty Distribution

**Issue**: Medium examples dominate (47%) - model might struggle with hard cases

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ Use difficulty-stratified evaluation
- ✅ Report per-difficulty metrics
- ✅ Consider difficulty-weighted loss if needed

### 11.4 Potential Issue: Injection Length Correlation

**Issue**: Longer examples correlate with difficulty - model might use length as shortcut

**Mitigation**:
- ✅ This is expected behavior (complex attacks need more tokens)
- ✅ Monitor if model relies purely on length
- ✅ Use attention visualization to verify content-based learning

**Overall Risk**: ⚠️ **LOW** - Standard issues with known mitigations
