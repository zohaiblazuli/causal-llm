## Output Files

All validation scripts save detailed reports to `data/processed/`:

| File | Generated By | Contents |
|------|--------------|----------|
| `loading_test_results.json` | test_data_loading.py | Loading validation results |
| `counterfactual_analysis.json` | analyze_counterfactuals.py | Counterfactual quality metrics |
| `attack_diversity_analysis.json` | analyze_attack_diversity.py | Attack diversity metrics |
| `dataset_statistics_final.json` | compute_statistics.py | Comprehensive statistics |
| `integrity_report.json` | integrity_checks.py | Integrity check results |

---

## Dependencies

### Required
- Python 3.8+
- numpy

### Optional (for full functionality)
- sentence-transformers (counterfactual semantic analysis)
- scikit-learn (ML metrics)
- transformers (accurate token counting)
- torch (for transformers)

### Fallback Behavior
- Without sentence-transformers: Uses word frequency vectors instead of embeddings
- Without transformers: Uses word count estimation for tokens
- Scripts remain functional with reduced accuracy

---

## Performance Characteristics

### Runtime (on typical dataset ~10K examples)

| Script | With All Deps | Without Optional |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| test_data_loading.py | 30s | 30s |
| analyze_counterfactuals.py | 2-5min | 1-2min |
| analyze_attack_diversity.py | 1-2min | 1-2min |
| compute_statistics.py | 3-5min | 1-2min |
| integrity_checks.py | 1-2min | 1-2min |
| **Total (run_all)** | **8-16min** | **5-10min** |

### Memory Usage
- Peak: ~2GB (with transformers)
- Average: ~500MB (basic validation)
- Sampling used to control memory

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing dependencies**
   - Install with pip
   - Scripts will warn and continue with reduced functionality

2. **Files not found**
   - Ensure dataset splits exist in `data/processed/`
   - Check file names match expected

3. **Out of memory**
   - Reduce sample sizes in scripts
   - Run validations individually
   - Close other applications

4. **Slow performance**
   - First run downloads models (one-time)
   - Subsequent runs faster
   - Use sampling for large datasets

---

## Testing and Verification

All scripts have been tested with:
- Valid dataset files
- Missing files (error handling)
- Corrupted JSON (error handling)
- Empty datasets
- Large datasets (50K+ examples)

**Verification Status:** COMPLETE

All scripts:
- Run without errors
- Produce expected output
- Generate correct reports
- Return appropriate exit codes
- Handle edge cases gracefully

---

## Integration with Training Pipeline

### Before Training

Run validation suite and ensure:
1. All tests PASS or WARNING
2. No FAIL statuses
3. Review and document all warnings
4. Complete validation report
5. Sign off

### During Training

Monitor for issues that might indicate data problems:
- Training loss not decreasing
- Validation metrics poor
- Model generating invalid outputs

If issues occur, re-run validations on training data.

### After Training

Compare validation metrics with model performance:
- Did high-quality data lead to better models?
- Were any validation warnings correlated with poor performance?
- Update validation thresholds if needed

---

   - Alert system for failures
   - Trend tracking over time

4. **Visualization**
   - Interactive dashboards
   - Distribution plots
   - Heatmaps for coverage
   - Quality trends over time

---

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks

- Run validations after any data changes

- Test with new Python versions

### Version Control

All validation scripts are version controlled:
- Track changes over time
