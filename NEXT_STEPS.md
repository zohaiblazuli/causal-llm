- [x] CUDA-enabled PyTorch installed successfully
- [x] **GPU Detected: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060** (Great news!)
- [x] CUDA 11.8 working perfectly

## 🎯 What You Need to Do Now

### Step 1: Get HuggingFace Token & Access

1. **Create/Login to HuggingFace account** at https://huggingface.co

2. **Request access to Llama 2**
   - Go to: https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf
   - Click "Agree and access repository"
   - This is REQUIRED - wait for approval (usually instant)

3. **Create an Access Token**
   - Go to: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
   - Click "New token"
   - Name it something like "isef-training"
   - Select "Read" permission (that's all you need)
   - Click "Create token"
   - **Copy the token immediately** (you won't see it again!)

4. **Login with the token**
   ```bash
   huggingface-cli login
   ```
   - Paste your token when prompted
   - Answer 'n' to git credential question

   **Common Issues:**
   - Make sure to copy the ENTIRE token (starts with `hf_...`)
   - Don't include any spaces or newlines
   - If you get "Bad Request" error, the token might be incomplete or you haven't accepted Llama 2 license

### Step 2: Verify Setup

After successful login, run:
```bash
python training/verify_setup.py
```

Expected: 7-8 out of 9 checks should pass

### Step 3: Quick Dry Run (Optional but Recommended)

Test with 10 steps to make sure everything works:
```bash
python training/dry_run.py --steps 10
```

Expected: Should complete in 2-3 minutes without errors

### Step 4: Start Training!

Once verification passes:
```bash
python training/train.py --config training/config.yaml
```

**Training Details:**
- Duration: ~2 hours for 3 epochs
- Your GPU: RTX 3060 (excellent for this task!)
- Memory usage: ~4-5GB out of available VRAM
- Expected speed: 0.5-1.0 steps/second

## 📊 What to Expect During Training

### Good Signs:
- ✅ Loss decreases steadily (from ~10 to ~2-3)
- ✅ Causal stability increases (target >0.80)
- ✅ Spurious separation increases (target >0.75)
- ✅ Memory stays <6GB
- ✅ No NaN/Inf values

### Warning Signs:
- ⚠️ Loss plateaus too early
- ⚠️ Memory usage creeping up
- ⚠️ Very slow training (<0.3 steps/sec)

### Critical Issues (Stop Training):
- 🚨 CUDA Out of Memory errors
- 🚨 NaN/Inf in losses
- 🚨 Crash/freeze

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If HuggingFace Login Fails:
1. Make sure you've accepted Llama 2 license at https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf
2. Create a new token with "Read" permission
3. Copy the ENTIRE token (starts with `hf_`)
4. Try the newer command: `hf auth login`

### If Training Fails with OOM:
Already optimized for 6GB, but if issues occur:
1. Check `training/config.yaml` - max_seq_length should be 1024
2. Gradient accumulation should be 16
3. Batch size should be 1

### If Training is Very Slow:
1. Verify CUDA is being used: Run the verify command above
2. Check GPU utilization: `nvidia-smi` in another terminal
3. Make sure no other programs are using the GPU

## 📈 Your Current Status

**Phase 1:** ✅ COMPLETE (100%)
- Theory, dataset, training pipeline all ready

**Phase 2:** 🟡 95% Ready
- Just need HuggingFace login, then can train immediately

**Next Milestone:** Complete training → Phase 2 Week 1 done

## 🎓 Key Project Stats

- **Dataset:** 8,939 training examples ready
- **Model:** Llama 2 7B with LoRA (4-bit quantization)
- **Hardware:** RTX 3060 (perfect for this project!)
- **Training time:** ~2 hours
- **Target:** Attack success rate <10%

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Monitor training:** Watch the loss and metrics in terminal
2. **Don't interrupt:** Let it complete all 3 epochs
3. **Check checkpoints:** Saved every 200 steps to `checkpoints/`
4. **Document results:** Take screenshots of final metrics

## 📞 If You Get Stuck

1. Check `CONTINUATION_STATUS.md` for detailed info
2. Check `PHASE2_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md` for week-by-week plan
3. Check `training/README.md` for training system docs
4. Try the verification script: `python training/verify_setup.py`

## 🚀 You're Almost There!

Just one more step (HuggingFace login) and you're ready to train! The hard work of setting up is done. Good luck! 🎉
