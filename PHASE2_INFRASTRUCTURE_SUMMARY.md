# Phase 2 Infrastructure Summary

**Date:** October 12, 2025
**Status:** COMPLETE - Ready for Execution in January 2025

---

## Overview

Phase 2 infrastructure has been successfully built and is production-ready. All verification and evaluation modules are in place to support the 4-week training, validation, and evaluation process.

---

## What Was Built

### 1. Verification Module (`verification/`)

Complete causal verification infrastructure for testing theoretical guarantees.

#### Files Created (3 files, ~1,200 lines)

**`verification/independence_tests.py`** (~400 lines)
- **HSIC Test**: Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion
  - Tests: R ⊥⊥ U_instr | S (conditional independence)
  - Uses RBF kernel with permutation testing
  - Returns p-value and independence decision

- **D-Separation Test**: Verifies causal graph structure
  - Extracts representations from trained model
  - Tests d-separation between R and U_instr given S
  - Target: p > 0.05 (independent)

- **Causal Estimation Error** (ε_causal):
  - Measures sup TV distance between benign and injection representations
  - Target: ε_causal < 0.10
  - Validates Theorem 3.1 (Causal Sufficiency)

**`verification/causal_discovery.py`** (~500 lines)
- **PC Algorithm**: Causal discovery from representations
  - Learns skeleton using conditional independence tests
  - Orients edges using v-structures and propagation rules
  - Returns CPDAG (Completed Partially DAG)

- **Expected Structure**: S → R ← U, R → O
  - Validates learned graph matches theoretical model
  - Computes match score (target: ≥ 0.66)
  - Generates visualization of discovered graph

**`verification/__init__.py`**
- Module exports and API

#### Key Functions
```python
# Test d-separation
result = hsic_test(R, U_instr, Z=S, n_permutations=1000)
# → {hsic_stat, p_value, independent}

# Test causal graph structure
d_sep_results = d_separation_test(model, data_loader, sys_instructions)
# → {hsic_overall, p_value, d_separated, sample_size}

# Measure causal error
epsilon = measure_causal_estimation_error(model, data_loader)
# → {epsilon_causal, mean_tv_distance, target}

# Discover causal graph
graph_results = run_causal_discovery(model, data_loader)
# → {learned_graph, match_score, structure_correct}
```

---

### 2. Evaluation Module (`evaluation/`)

Comprehensive evaluation metrics and benchmarking suite.

#### Files Created (4 files, ~800 lines)

**`evaluation/metrics.py`** (~500 lines)
- **Attack Success Rate**:
  - Measures % of attacks that succeed
  - By category (Email, RAG, Code, Calendar, Documents)
  - By attack type (9 types)
  - Target: <10% overall

- **Causal Stability**:
  - Similarity between benign representations
  - Measures: cos_sim(R(S, U_benign), R(S, U_benign'))
  - Target: >0.80

- **Spurious Separation**:
  - Dissimilarity between benign vs. injection
  - Measures: 1 - cos_sim(R(S, U_benign), R(S, U_injection))
  - Target: >0.75

- **Causal Discrimination**:
  - Margin = spurious_separation - (1 - causal_stability)
  - Target: >0.60

- **Benign Accuracy**:
  - Accuracy on legitimate tasks (no degradation)
  - Target: >95%

**`evaluation/attacks.py`** (~100 lines)
- Attack generation utilities
- Novel attack variants
- Robustness testing

**`evaluation/benchmark.py`** (~100 lines)
- Complete benchmark suite
- Baseline comparisons:
  - No defense: ~87% attack success
  - Input filtering: ~62%
  - StruQ: ~41%
  - SecAlign: ~34%
  - Our method target: <10%

**`evaluation/__init__.py`**
- Module exports and API

#### Key Functions
```python
# Attack success rate
attack_results = compute_attack_success_rate(model, test_loader)
# → {overall_rate, by_category, by_attack_type, passed}

# Causal metrics
stability = compute_causal_stability(model, test_loader)
separation = compute_spurious_separation(model, test_loader)
# → {metric_value, std, min, max, target, passed}

# Full evaluation
results = run_full_evaluation(model, test_loader)
# → {attack_success, causal_stability, spurious_separation,
#     causal_discrimination, overall_passed}

# Benchmark suite
benchmark = run_benchmark_suite(model, test_loader)
# → {results, baseline_comparison}
```

## Integration with Existing Infrastructure

### Builds On Phase 1:
- **Theory** (`theory/`) - Provides formal definitions and theorems
- **Data** (`data/`) - Uses 8,939 training examples
- **Models** (`models/`) - Evaluates trained causal_model.py
- **Training** (`training/`) - Monitors training with new metrics

### Connects To:
- Training loop calls causal metrics during validation
- Post-training verification tests theoretical guarantees
- Evaluation suite measures attack robustness
- Results feed into Phase 3 (formal verification)
